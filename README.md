tipsy
=====

Tip Calculator iOS demo project.

Took a few hours (did it in a day between lunch and dinner).

Completed the basics along with a nicer background (it's supposed to be a receipt, use your imagination if you don't see it :P), tip rounding, and adding a dollar sign to the input field.

Sorry for the grainy edge on the gif; I'm not sure what happened.
